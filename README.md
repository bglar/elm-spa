It's a functional, strongly typed, static programming language designed by Evan Czaplicki in 2012

What you need to know about it: <Read more from the official page>

    - Functional Programming Language
    - Strongly typed and Static Language.
    - A typed functional programming language 
        - High Order functions
        - Monads
        - Currying
        - Folding
        - Recurssion
        - Lists, tuples, sets
        - Pattern Matching
    - User (frontend developer) focused
    - An application development framework
    - Maintainability
        - Static type checking 
        - Atomatic Semantic Versioning
    - Features
        - Interoperability with JavaScript
        - Virtual DOM
        - Rich Error Messages
        - Zero Runtime Exceptions
    - All data is immutable
    - `null`/`undefined`/Exceptions don't exist
    - Built in: 
        - Get packages e.g node
        - compile packages e.g Webpack
        - Architect code i.e React/Angular/Vue
        - State management i.e Redux
        - Type-checking and flow i.e
        - Immutability i.e immutable.js

Why Elm

    - Elm's compiler prevents runtime errors i.e no exceptions in production
    - The language compiles to JavaScript
